## **Emission rate** <a href="emission-rate" id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

| **Metric**                     | **Emission/block (WAP)** | **Emission/day (WAP)** |
| ------------------------------ | -----------------------: | ---------------------: |
| Emission                       |                     0.16 |               4,608.00 |
| Burned (Inactive Lottery Fund) |                    0.008 |                -230.40 |
| **Effective Emission**         |             **<0.152\*** |         **4,377.60\*** |

\*Effective Emission is 0.152 WAP as 230.40 WAP per day is diverted to the lottery wallet, and burned (It will be burned every week until we start our lottery feature).

## Distribution <a href="distribution" id="distribution"></a>

| Distributed to               | Reward/block (% of emission) | Reward/block (total WAP) |            Reward/day |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------: | -----------------------: | --------------------: |
| Farms                        |                          60% |                   0.0912 |     2,626.56 (approx) |
| Staking Pools                |                          40% |                   0.0608 |     1,751.04 (approx) |
| **Total Daily WAP Emission** |                              |                          | **4,377.60 (approx)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** <a href="other-deflationary-mechanics" id="other-deflationary-mechanics"></a>

At present, WAP is also burned in the following ways:

* **0.05%** of every trade made on WapSwap.
* **0.5%** of every cross chain swap transaction made on WapSwap.
* **100%** of farming and staking pool rewards if unstake, harvest or compound is done before 168 hours (7 days) after staking.
* **50%** emissions will be reduced every 4 years until it reaches max supply.
* **230.40** WAP per day is diverted to the lottery wallet, and burned (It will be burned every week until we start our lottery feature).

The burning process is currently manual.
